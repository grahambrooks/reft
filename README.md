# REFT - automated source code REFactoring Tool

REFT is an attempt to build a tool that (initially) applies
refactoring changes to source code based on a specification. An
initial application of the tool would be to release a specification
detailing changes to code that calls into a library that has an
updated interface.

## Status

Pre-release - under development.
